## *outside-sqlite3*: sqlite3 API definitions for the Go language *(PRERELEASE)*

#### Fire off quick questions to [@tHinqa](http://twitter.com/tHinqa) on Twitter

#### Covered by the same licence conditions as Go is

### For use with [*outside*](https://github.com/tHinqa/outside)

### Includes outside-sqlite3/driver for database/sql/driver support (installed separately)
The driver needs at least go1.2rc1 to fix 64-bit returns (and also add [::] slice denomination). Driver code is based largely on [*mattn/go-sqlite3*](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3) which is Copyright 2012-2013 Yasuhiro Matsumoto. See the code for further information.
